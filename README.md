# Tarea Integradora 2 (Snakes And Ladders)

This project consists of creating the "Snakes And Ladders" videogame, using the Eclipse IDE (Java), with the next characteristics:

- Console mode
- Recursive programming
- MVC architecture (see ```src``` folder)
- With Lists and Trees
- Without arrays or similar structures (ArrayList, Collections, etc.)

So far a hard job! ;)

Here is a screenshot of the running game [board: 4x5, gamers: #$%, ladders: 11 22 33, snakes: AA BB]:
```
[    ][3   ][    ][    ][    ]
[2  $][A   ][B   ][    ][3   ]
[    ][B   ][    ][    ][1   ]
[   %][A  #][2   ][1   ][    ]
```
In the folder ```docs``` you will find the documents that support the [specification of requirements](docs/REQUERIMIENTOS_FUNCIONALES.pdf) and the [class diagram](docs/ClassDiagram.pdf) including the packages (MVC).

Enjoy!
