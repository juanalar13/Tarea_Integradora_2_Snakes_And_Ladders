# Tarea_Integradora_2_Snakes_And_Ladders

This project consists of creating the Snakes And Ladders video game in Console mode, using the Eclipse (Java) development environment, using recursive programming, MVC architecture (see caperta src), no arrangements, only linked lists, so it was a tedious job .

In the docs folder you will find the documents such as the functional requirements and the class diagram including the packages.

Enjoy!
